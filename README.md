# ASCII Art Generation Using Python (Minor-II Project)

## Description  
This project is based on ASCII Art generation using Python. ASCII art is a technique in which images are represented using text characters instead of graphical pixels. In this project, basic Python concepts like loops and conditional statements are used to create an ASCII art image.  

For demonstration purposes, a reference image of Raghuram Rajan, former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has been used. However, the main focus of this project is learning ASCII art generation, not the personality itself.

## Objectives  
- To understand ASCII art generation  
- To practice Python loops and conditions  
- To improve logical thinking  
- To create text-based patterns using Python  

## Concepts Used  
- for loop  
- nested loops  
- if-elif-else statements  
- variables  
- print formatting  

## How It Works  
The program uses a fixed number of rows and columns to create a grid. Each position in the grid is checked using row and column values, and a specific ASCII character is printed based on conditions. This logic finally creates the complete ASCII art.

## How to Run  
```bash
python generate_ascii_art.py
